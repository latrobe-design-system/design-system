Alignment is an important fundamental of design.

Graphic and UI designers utilise a grid to achieve pleasing designs with well connected content and consisent vertical and horizontal rythm or spacing.

Our typography vertical spacing is based on 4px increments.

By adopting 4px increments for all vertical and horizontal spacings we can achieve a well aligned harmonious UI without working to a hard grid.

__All spacing on the site is to be in 4px increments: font-size, line-height, margins, padding__
